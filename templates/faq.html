			<h4>
				What is Vasco de Gapi?  What does it explore?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Vaso de Gapi explores the newly released Google Analytics API.  You can emulate any type of data pull available through the API.  Vasco de Gapi handles it for you.  For every Google Analytics API pull, you can also download the code used to make that specific API call, to ease automation of API data pulls.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Do I need Google Analytics to use Vasco de Gapi?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Yes!  Get it at the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics site<a>.
			</p>
			<h4>
				I am not getting back any data.  What is wrong?
			</h4>
			<p>
				I likely means that the selected data slice has a limited amount of data available.  You may have selected a very restrictive filter, or picked the wrong site in Google Analytics.  The date ranges could be from a time before the site was set up.  The best thing to do could be to attempt to replicate the profile/filter/selection in the actual Google Analytics website.
			</p>
			<h4>
				How many observations can Vasco de Gapi pull from the API?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Currently, Vasco de Gapi is limited to pulling 10,000 observations.  If you need to pull more data, you can convince your code monkeys to download the automatically generated code, and scale up the limitations.  You may also leave a comment {{here}}, and if this is a highly-desired feature, we may consider increasing the limit.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Can I sort by more than one dimension or metric?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Not yet.  Leave a comment {{here}}, and we just might add in that feature.
